AuctionSite for Mum and dads
My take on a auction site dedicated to mum and dads living in Australia and New Zealand. Currently two most popular auction site are charging
1. TradeMe 7.9%
2. Ebay.com.au 10.9%

I hope to establish a market where mum and dads don't have to pay high success fee and are able to sell items with reasonable price.
